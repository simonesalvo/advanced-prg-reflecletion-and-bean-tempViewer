# Java Beans and Reflection

__Import the created bean TempSensor jar.__

Create the project TempViewer and the class TempFrame that extends a JFrame. 
Add to this frame a JLabel, a JButton and the TempSensor. 

The idea is that when the user clicks on the button the TempSensor starts the sensing and the label shows the values periodically generated by TempSensor. 
To do that, link the property currentTemp of TempSensor with the property text of JLabel. 

__Export the project in the jar file TempViewer.jar.__

__Solution format: Source java files and jar file TempViewer.jar.__
